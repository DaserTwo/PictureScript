# PictureScript
A simple scripting language for generating pictures.

# Let's get started
Inside `examples` folder you can find... examples. You can run `pnggen.py`, click on load and choose one of these. If you like what you see, you can save. The script depends on tkinter and pillow.

``` Console
$ pip install pillow
$ python3 pnggen.py
```

You can also create gifs, but you'll see only the last frame in preview. You need to save and open the result gif if you want to see anything moving.
